3. Write a problem to trace the customers and the status of the tellers in a bank. The first line of the input stores the number of tellers in the bank. Next lines contain the information of customers as follows: 
 ArrivalTime Name OccupiedTime 
  When a customer arrives, he/she will come to the first teller. If the first teller is busy, he/she will go to next teller and so on. If all tellers are busy, the customer will line up in the waiting queue.  
 
 The program should output the status of each teller and waiting queue for each second until all customers have been served.  
 
Be noted that you can assume the information in the input is in order. The last line of input containing the number -1 signals the end of the input. 
 
Example: Input:
 3 2 Tom 5 2 Mary 2 4 Ann 2 5 Peter 1 5 Annie 1 5 John 2 5 Rebecca 1 6 May 2 7 Jessica 1 7 Kelvin 1 -1 
 Output: 1: Teller1: NULL Teller2: NULL Teller3: NULL Waiting: NULL 
 2: Teller1: Tom Teller2: Mary Teller3: NULL Waiting: NULL 
 3: Teller1: Tom Teller2: Mary Teller3: NULL Waiting: NULL
